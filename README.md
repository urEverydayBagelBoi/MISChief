# MISChief
A purist miscellaneous discord bot written in python using discord.py.


## Important note
This is ***NOT*** in any way intended to be a serious project, and is purely me learning and practicing how to code. Any ideas, feedback or even contributions are still appreciated, but this is a **personal project** with no promise or garuantee of support or active development from me if ever or until stated otherwise. The only thing I ask for is as much feedback as you feel like giving.

There currently isn't much of anything to this project, but this README will be updated as I flesh out both my skills and the project itself.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    For example:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    - **On Windows**:
        ```sh
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - **On macOS and Linux**:
        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. Install the dependencies:
