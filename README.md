# MISChief
A purist miscellaneous discord bot written in python using discord.py.


## Important note
This is ***NOT*** in any way intended to be a serious project, and is purely me learning and practicing how to code. Any ideas, feedback or even contributions are still appreciated, but this is a **personal project** with no promise or garuantee of support or active development from me if ever or until stated otherwise. The only thing I ask for is as much feedback as you feel like giving.

There currently isn't much of anything to this project, but this README will be updated as I flesh out both my skills and the project itself.
